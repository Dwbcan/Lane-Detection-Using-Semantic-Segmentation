# Lane-Detection-Using-Semantic-Segmentation
 Detection and Hough Transform computer vision algorithms with OpenCV to perform lane detection through semantic segmentation on JPEG image and 31.9MB video. Converted image to grayscale, applying Gaussian Blur OpenCV algorithm to filter image noise, modifying resolution by 33.2%. Highlighted regions of high pixel gradience using Canny Edge Detection, masking 67.1% of pixels to isolate region of interest.
